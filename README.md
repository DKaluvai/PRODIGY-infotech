## Introduction

Welcome to my first machine learning project! The goal is to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implemented three models to identify the best one for price prediction.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I analyzed data distributions, identified outliers, handled missing values, and visualized key trends. EDA guided the modeling decisions and ensured a comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Model Comparison

I implemented three models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Each model's performance was evaluated and compared to assess their effectiveness in predicting prices.

## Results

Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most accurate model, with superior performance metrics, including a mean RMSE after cross-validation. This model was chosen for final price prediction.

## Future Steps

Future plans include exploring additional feature engineering techniques, experimenting with advanced models, and optimizing the selected model for better accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project marks my entry into machine learning. Through EDA and model comparison, I gained valuable insights and identified a robust model for predicting prices. This experience lays the foundation for future projects and continuous learning.
